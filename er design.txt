Entity Relationship Design

The online shopping system is a client-server-based web application. Each company should produce at least one product. Each provider has one company identified by `company_id`. One company may make multiple products. Each company has a `Company_name`. Companies transport products to providers. Providers have their own unique `provider_id`, `provider_lastname`, and `provider_firstname`. Providers then service sellers so that sellers can sell products to customers. Sellers consult customers on product selection. There are many customers who list their products on their own wishlist. The shopping site has a huge number of products. Each product is identified by its `product_ID` and has a `product_name`. Products have comments which consist of `product_id` and rating. Many customers can create wishlists and list their products with `product_price`. After the customer makes a choice, they make the payment online. Every customer pays with the help of their own `shopping_card`. After payment, the order will be accepted. Customers can track their order by a unique `order_ID` provided by the shopping site. In the order section, each customer can see what products and in what quantity they ordered. Each order is shipped by shipment. There are two categories of shipment: Post and Delivery. If the customer chooses Delivery, each order has its own `delivery_id` and also includes information about the address and driver (courier). If the customer chooses Post, each post order is identified by `postal_id` and, with the help of the postal code, finds the address of the customer.
